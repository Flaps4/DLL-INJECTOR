# DLL-INJECTOR 
A project started while sick having covid. 

The project is meant to be a learning process for me. First of all how to use c++ in a more advanced and deeper state and how to use it to develope different types of injectors, security resarching programs, and test malwares. 

This is just the beginning and its focused on dllÂ´s (dynamic link libraries), which you can inject in in kernel to then exploit different types of programs, or software.

If you are interested, please feel freee to commit and make my work better.

Best Regards FLAPS4
